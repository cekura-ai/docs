These are standard metrics applicable across domains defined by Cekura. Below is a list of supported pre-defined metrics.

* **AI Interrupting User**: Tells if the AI (main agent) interrupted the user (testing agent) during the interaction. NOTE: This only works on stereo recordings.

* **Average Latency (in ms)**: Tells the average response latency for the AI agent in milliseconds.

* **Average Pitch (in Hz)**: Returns the average pitch of the AI Agent (Main agent) during the call in Hertz.

* **Instruction Following Metric**: Checks critical deviations from the expected workflows and tells where it deviated.

* **CSAT**: Gives a score for customer satisfaction and tells the reason for dissatisfaction.

* **Not Early Termination**: Checks if the call was ended early by the user, indicating poor user experience or unresolved issues. This metric is True if...

* **Sentiment**: Determines whether the human's overall sentiment towards the AI agent during the conversation was "happy"...

* **Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Signal to Noise Ratio when the AI agent (Main agent) is speaking. Compares the noise level of Main Agent against Testing Agent.

* **Talk Ratio**: The ratio of time duration the AI Agent (Main agent) is speaking compared to the duration the User (Test Agent) is speaking.

* **User Interrupting AI**: Tells if the user (testing agent) interrupted the AI (main agent) during the interaction. NOTE: This only works on stereo recordings.

* **Voice Quality Index**: Evaluates the overall voice quality of the AI agent based on three key factors: clarity (how clear and understandable the voice is), tone (appropriateness of tone for the context), and appropriateness (whether the speech fits the context and intent). Returns a score from 0-5 where higher scores indicate better voice quality. NOTE: This metric requires audio recordings for analysis.

* **Response Consistency**: Checks if the responses of your AI Agent are consistent across the duration of a call. This metric detects two specific cases:
  * When a user provides information (like their name) and the AI agent repeats it back incorrectly
  * When the AI agent provides contradictory information during the same call (e.g., saying X at the start and Y at the end which contradicts the earlier statement)

* **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Monitors speech speed of AI Agent (Main Agent) to ensure natural and understandable delivery.
