## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up and monitoring your Retell-based voice agents using Cekura's observability suite. Learn how to configure your integration and access powerful monitoring tools.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-fetch">
    With auto-fetch enabled, Cekura automatically pulls your call data from Retell's API every 30 seconds—no webhook configuration required.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create or select an agent">
        In your Cekura dashboard, create a new agent or select an existing one with Retell as the voice provider.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add credentials to Cekura">
        In your Cekura Agent Settings page:
        1. Select **Retell** as the voice integration provider
        2. Add your Retell API key
        3. Enter your Retell `agent ID`
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable auto-fetch">
        Toggle on **Auto-fetch Production Calls** in the voice integration settings.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Test your integration">
        Make a test call from Retell. Within 30 seconds, your call should appear in the Cekura observability `Calls` section.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
    Auto-fetch is ideal for getting started quickly or when you can't configure webhooks. For real-time call data, use the webhook-based setup in the other tabs.
    </Tip>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No-code Retell Integration">
    Follow these steps to connect your Retell agent with Cekura's observability suite:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure webhook URL in Retell">
        In your Retell dashboard, add the observability webhook URL:

        ```
        https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/retell/observe/
        ```

        You can configure the webhook at either level:
        - **Setting Webhook at Agent level:** Navigate to your agent settings and add the webhook URL for a specific agent.

        - **Setting Webhook at Workspace level:** Navigate to your workspace settings and add the webhook URL for all agents in the workspace.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Retell API key">
        Go to the API keys section in your Retell dashboard. Create/ensure you have at least one API key configured with the webhook tag set.

        1. Add the API key from Retell with the tag `webhook`

      </Step>
      <Step title="Test your integration">

      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Tab title="Forwarding Retell response">
    If you already have an existing webhook setup and want to forward the Retell response to Cekura's observability suite:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure forwarding endpoint">
        Set up a forwarding mechanism to send the Retell webhook response to Cekura's observability endpoint:

        ```
        POST https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/observe/
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add authentication headers">
        Include your Cekura API key in the request headers:

        ```
        X-CEKURA-API-KEY: <your_cekura_api_key>
        Content-Type: application/json
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Forward the request body">
        Forward the Retell webhook response to Cekura with the following request body structure:

        ```json
        {
          "agent": <agent_id_in_cekura>,
          "voice_recording_url": retell_response["recording_multi_channel_url"],
