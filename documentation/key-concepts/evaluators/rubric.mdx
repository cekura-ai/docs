## What is Rubric Configuration?

Rubric Configuration allows you to define exactly when an evaluation should be marked as successful or failed. Instead of using default logic, you can create custom rules based on multiple metrics, set specific thresholds, and combine conditions with AND/OR logic.

### Why Use Rubric Configuration?

- Define success criteria tailored to your use case
- Combine multiple metrics to determine overall success
- Set specific thresholds for different metric types
- Automatically pass/fail evaluations based on your rules

## Navigation

To configure a rubric for your project:

1. Click on the **Rubric** tab

## Configuring Your Rubric

The rubric configuration page allows you to define rules for each metric in your project.

### Components

Each rule consists of:

- **Metric**: Select which metric to evaluate
- **Operator**: The comparison operator (e.g., greater than or equal, less than or equal, equals, in)
- **Value**: The threshold or expected value

## Common Examples

### Example 1: All Boolean Metrics Must Pass

For evaluations to succeed, all binary metrics must have a score of 5 (success):

- **Rule 1**: Workflow Adherence score greater than or equal to 5
- **Rule 2**: Task Completion score greater than or equal to 5

### Example 2: Acceptable Latency Threshold

Require low latency in addition to workflow adherence:

- **Rule 1**: Workflow Adherence score greater than or equal to 5
- **Rule 2**: Latency score less than or equal to 2000

## Auto-Added Metrics

### Projects

For Projects, all default predefined metrics are automatically added to your rubric with appropriate success conditions. This gives you a ready-to-use rubric configuration from day one.

### New Boolean Metrics

When you create new boolean metrics (Binary Qualitative or Binary Workflow Adherence), they are automatically added to your rubric with a default success condition:

- **Operator**: greater than or equal
- **Value**: 5

This ensures new critical metrics are immediately included in your success evaluation.

## Tips

<Tip>
**Start Simple**: Begin with basic rules (e.g., all boolean metrics greater than or equal to 5) and add complexity as needed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Test Your Rubric**: After configuring, run evaluations and check if pass/fail results match your expectations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use Meaningful Thresholds**: Base thresholds on real requirements, not arbitrary numbers. For example, if 2000ms is your SLA, use that value.
</Tip>

## Metric Skipping

The rubric automatically skips certain metrics:

- Metrics with null/empty values
- Metrics marked as irrelevant

When all rules are skipped, the evaluation defaults to success.
