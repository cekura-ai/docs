description: "Introduction to Instructions for Evaluators on Cekura"
---

Each evaluator has a set of instructions that define how it should behave during a simulation run. These instructions guide the evaluator's conversation flow, what information to provide, and how to respond to your agent.

During a simulation run, evaluators follow their instructions to engage in realistic conversations with your agent. In the transcript of a simulation run, dialogues said by evaluators are labeled as **Testing Agents**.

### Extra Intructions (Automatic):

  Extra Instructions is an optional field incase specific evaluators to be
  generated. Incase the feild is empty Cekura creates a different evaluator for
  maximum coverage.

- "Generate evaluators where the user is trying to cancel an appointment"
- "Call to cancel an appointment scheduled for next Tuesday"
- "Inquire about store hours and ask about product availability"
- "Request a refund for order #12345 and escalate if initially denied"

### Instructions (Manual)

Cekura provides the option to add an evaluator manually. User can provide the instructions on how it should behave in a simulation run in the **Instructions** field.

**Example Instruction Prompt:**

```
<scenario>
- You are calling a customer support agent to return an order.
- Begin by being slightly unsure about your exact order name.
- When asked about your name and order id, at first give incorrect order id.
- Correct it after agent denies request.
- Be ready to provide other information when requested.
</scenario>
```

<Note>
  Refer to the test agent in first person like "You are". Do not provide exact
  steps like when AI Agent says "xyz", do this. Do not mention exact line to
  speak unless necessary.
