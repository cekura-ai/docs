## How Voice Integration Works

Cekura's voice integration system allows you to evaluate your voice agents by receiving detailed transcripts from your voice provider. This approach enables comprehensive analysis of both conversational flows and tool usage patterns.

### The Integration Process

When you integrate your voice provider with Cekura, the following process occurs:

1. **Call Initiation**: Your voice agent handles a call using your chosen provider (Retell, VAPI, etc.)
2. **Transcript Generation**: The provider generates a detailed transcript including dialogue, timing, and metadata
3. **Data Transmission**: The transcript is sent to Cekura's observability API with tool call information
4. **Evaluation**: Cekura analyzes the conversation and tool usage against your defined metrics
5. **Results**: Detailed evaluation results are available in your dashboard

## Transcript-Based Evaluation

### What Gets Evaluated

Cekura analyzes multiple aspects of your voice interactions:

- **Conversation Quality**: How well the agent follows instructions and maintains context
- **Tool Usage**: Whether tools are called correctly with appropriate parameters
- **Response Timing**: How quickly the agent responds and processes information
- **Error Handling**: How the agent manages unexpected situations or tool failures

### Supported Transcript Formats

Cekura supports multiple transcript formats, each with specific capabilities for tool call analysis:

| Provider | Tool Calls Supported | Format Details |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Cekura** | ✅ Full support | Function calls and results with detailed metadata |
| **VAPI** | ✅ Full support | Tool calls with structured parameters and responses |
| **Retell** | ✅ Full support | Tool call invocations and results with timing |
| **ElevenLabs** | ✅ Full support | Comprehensive tool call tracking with execution details |
| **Custom** | ✅ Full support | Flexible format supporting function calls and results |
| **Deepgram** | ❌ Audio only | Word-level transcription without tool information |
| **Pipecat** | ❌ Basic conversation | Simple dialogue format |
| **Livekit** | ❌ Basic conversation | Timestamped dialogue only |

## Tool Call Evaluation

### Understanding Tool Calls in Transcripts

When your voice agent uses tools or functions, this information is captured in the transcript and can be evaluated by Cekura. Here's what gets analyzed:

#### Tool Call Structure
```json
{
  "role": "Function Call",
  "data": {
    "id": "call_5otWH44dxeXEHY8RlhYYaFbV",
    "name": "bookUserAppointment",
    "arguments": "{\"name\": \"John\", \"datetime\": \"2024-10-17T18:00:00\"}"
  },
  "start_time": 23.164,
  "end_time": 23.164
}
```

#### Tool Result Analysis
```json
{
  "role": "Function Call Result",
  "data": {
    "id": "call_5otWH44dxeXEHY8RlhYYaFbV",
    "name": "bookUserAppointment",
    "result": "Appointment successfully booked for John at 6 PM today"
  },
  "start_time": 24.6,
  "end_time": 24.6
}
```

### Evaluation Capabilities

With tool call information included in transcripts, Cekura can evaluate:

- **Correct Tool Selection**: Whether the agent chose the right tool for the task
- **Parameter Accuracy**: If the tool was called with correct and complete parameters
- **Error Handling**: How the agent responds to tool failures or unexpected results
- **Workflow Completion**: Whether multi-step processes using tools are completed successfully
- **Context Preservation**: If the agent maintains conversation context during tool usage
