<Tab title="Forwarding Retell response">

If you already have an existing webhook setup and want to forward the Retell response to Cekura's observability suite:

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your existing webhook response">
Capture the webhook response from Retell in your existing system. The response contains call data including transcript, recording URL, and call metadata.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure forwarding endpoint">
Set up a forwarding mechanism to send the Retell webhook response to Cekura's observability endpoint:

```
POST https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/observe/
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add authentication headers">
Include your Cekura API key in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_cekura_api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
```
</Step>

<Step title="Forward the request body">
Forward the complete Retell webhook response to Cekura. The request body structure is shown in the example below.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Request Body Example

When forwarding Retell responses, here's what the request body will look like when creating a new call log entry in Cekura:

```json
{
  "agent": <agent_id_in_cekura>,
  "recording_url": retell_response["recording_url"],
  "transcript_type": "retell",
  "transcript_json": retell_response["transcript_with_tool_calls"],
  "call_id": retell_response["call_id"]
}
```
