## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up and monitoring your Retell-based voice agents using Vocera's observability suite. Learn how to configure your integration and access powerful monitoring tools.

## Setting Up Retell Integration

### Observability Configuration

To enable monitoring for your Retell agent, you'll need to configure the observability settings in your dashboard (either agent level as seen below or at organisation level). Use this URL:

```
https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/retell/observe/
```

### API Key Setup

Make sure you have a API key setup on Retell. Simply go to the API keys section and verify you have atleast 1 key.

### Vocera Integration

Add the key from Retell with the tag `webhook` to Vocera in the Agent Settings page. Ensure you have copied your `agent ID` from Retell as well.

You should be all set now. Simply make a call from Retell (phone number based or even webcall) to test it out. The calls will start appearing in the observability `Calls` section
