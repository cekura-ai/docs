## Overview

Learn how to monitor, analyze, and optimize your VAPI-based voice agents using Cekura's observability tools. This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring your VAPI integration.

## Configure VAPI Integration

Follow these steps to connect your VAPI agent with Cekura's observability suite:

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Server URL in VAPI">
In your VAPI dashboard, navigate to your agent settings and configure the Server URL. This URL is used for all communication between your application and VAPI, including context retrieval, function calls, and end-of-call reporting.

Set the Server URL to:
```
https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/vapi/observe/?agent_id=YOUR_AGENT_ID
```

</Step>

<Step title="Get your Assistant ID">
Each VAPI agent has a unique Assistant ID that identifies your specific implementation. Copy your Assistant ID from the VAPI dashboard:

</Step>

<Step title="Obtain your Cekura API key">
Navigate to the API Keys section in your [Cekura dashboard](https://dashboard.cekura.ai):

<img src="/images/get-vocera-api-key-1.png" alt="Navigate to API Keys" />

Copy your private API key from the modal:

<img src="/images/get-vocera-api-key-2.png" alt="Copy API Key" />

Keep this key secure and never share it publicly, as it provides access to your VAPI integration.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure API key in VAPI">
Set up the API key in VAPI so it will be included with each request to the server. This key is sent as a header `X-VAPI-SECRET` with each request for security purposes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Request Body Example

When using VAPI, here's what the request body will look like when creating a new call log entry in Cekura:

```json
{
  "agent": <agent_id_in_cekura>,
  "recording_url": vapi_response["recordingUrl"],
  "transcript_type": "vapi",
  "transcript_json": vapi_response["messages"],
  "call_id": vapi_response["id"]
}
```
