title: 'Agent Description Guide'
---
An Agent Description is a comprehensive overview of your voice conversational agent’s purpose, behavior, and operational guidelines. It encapsulates all the instructions, prompts, and rules you provide to your AI agent, acting as the foundational reference for how the agent should interact with users and handle various scenarios.

By clearly articulating your agent’s description, you enable us to **generate more accurate test scenarios** and **identify issues in production**.

Most customers include their `agent’s main prompt` here.
