## What is Auto Outbound Call?

Auto Outbound Call is an automated testing feature where Cekura automatically initiates outbound calls when you run evaluators. Unlike [manual outbound testing](/documentation/guides/testing-agents/outbound-evaluators) where you write scripts to handle calls, this feature does everything automatically.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auto Outbound">
    Toggle the **Auto Outbound Call** setting ON in your agent settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Evaluators">
    Execute evaluators through the dashboard - no script needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="System Calls Automatically">
    Cekura uses your voice provider (Vapi, Retell, or ElevenLabs) to initiate calls
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    Check test results and transcripts in your dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

- **Outbound mode enabled**: Agent's `inbound` must be set to `false`
- **Voice provider configured**: Valid API key and Assistant ID for your provider (Vapi, Retell, or ElevenLabs)
- **Evaluators ready**: Created evaluators with valid phone numbers

## Enabling Auto Outbound Call

Navigate to your agent settings and toggle **Auto Outbound Call** to ON.

<Note>
Ensure your voice provider account has sufficient credits for making calls.
</Note>

## Advanced: Trigger URL Webhook

For advanced use cases, you can configure a **Trigger URL** to receive webhook notifications instead of automatic calls. This lets you add custom logic before the call is made.

<Warning>
**Advanced Feature**: When you configure a trigger URL, Cekura sends a webhook to your endpoint **instead of** automatically calling. You must handle the actual call initiation yourself.
</Warning>

### When to Use

Use trigger URLs when you need to:
- Add validation or business logic before calls
- Schedule calls for specific times
- Integrate with internal systems
- Log or audit call requests

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Trigger URL">
    In your agent settings, navigate to the **Provider Data** field (Vapi Data / Retell Data / ElevenLabs Data) and enter your webhook URL.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/outbound-auto-call/configure-trigger-url.png" alt="Configure Trigger URL in UI" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Webhook">
    When evaluators run, Cekura sends a POST request to your URL with call details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make the Call">
    Your system processes the webhook and initiates the call using your provider's API
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook Payload

Cekura sends the following JSON payload to your trigger URL:

```json
{
  "from_number": "+1234567890",
  "to_number": "+14159976447",
  "dynamic_variables": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "policy_number": "POL123456"
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `from_number`: Your agent's contact number (the number making the call)
- `to_number`: The evaluator's phone number (where to call)
- `dynamic_variables`: Optional test profile data for dynamic prompting

<Note>
Your webhook endpoint must be publicly accessible (HTTPS), return a 200 or 201 status code, and respond within 30 seconds.
</Note>

### Response Format

Your webhook should return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "call_id": "optional_provider_call_id"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calls Not Starting">
    Check that Auto Outbound Call is enabled, agent is in Outbound mode, and voice provider credentials are valid.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Not Working">
    Verify trigger URL is publicly accessible (HTTPS), returns 200/201 status, and no firewall is blocking requests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- **Monitor credits**: Track your provider account balance
- **Valid numbers**: Use correct phone number format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- **Secure webhooks**: Use HTTPS, validate requests, implement rate limiting
