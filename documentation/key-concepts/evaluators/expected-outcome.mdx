<Note>
  Expected outcome is a specical linked to a specific evaluator unike other
  metric but unlike other metrics (which is defined for the entire agent).
</Note>

Evaluators have an **expected outcome** defined, which represents what should happen in a successful conversation. Once your evaluators complete a conversation with your agent, we evaluate those conversations to give you a report of how your agent performed.

Expected outcome is one key metric we evaluate the conversation on. This metric tells whether your AI Agent (called **Main Agent** on Cekura) did what it was supposed to do in the conversation.

### Expected Outcome Examples

| Scenario                 | Expected Outcome                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Account Verification     | - The Main Agent asks for Name and Date of Birth                                                       |
|                          | - The Main Agent attempts to get correct date of birth again                                           |
|                          | - After successful verification, the Main agent informs testing agent that return request is accepted. |
| Appointment Cancellation | - The main agent successfully cancels the appointment and provides a confirmation number               |
| Product Inquiry          | The main agent provides accurate product information and store hours                                   |
| Refund Request           | The main agent processes the refund request and provides a timeline for processing                     |

The expected outcome is evaluated as either met or not met, giving you clear visibility into whether your agent is performing as intended.
