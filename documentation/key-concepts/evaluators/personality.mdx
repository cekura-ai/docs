<Tip>
  **Best Practice**

  Start with normal personality. Once confident, add other personalities to test the agent's robustness.
</Tip>

## Overview

A personality defines how your evaluator behaves during conversations with your AI agent. It determines the language, tone, speed and behavioral characteristics of the testing agent, allowing you to simulate diverse real-world user interactions.

### Why Use Different Personalities?

Testing your AI agent against different personalities helps you:

- **Identify Edge Cases**: Discover how your agent responds to challenging conversational patterns
- **Test Real-World Conditions**: Simulate environments with background noise or interruptions
- **Ensure Accessibility**: Verify your agent works well with different languages and speaking styles

### Recommended Personality Mix

For comprehensive testing, consider creating evaluators with:

- 60% standard, clear communication
- 20% challenging conditions (background noise, interruptions)
- 10% non-native speakers or accent variations
- 10% edge cases (frustrated users, very fast/slow speakers)

This distribution mirrors real-world user demographics while ensuring thorough testing coverage.
