# Types of Metrics

Vocera offers several types of metrics for analyzing evaluating calls. Each metric type serves a specific purpose and returns results in a standardized format.

## Metric Categories

### Binary Workflow Adherence
Evaluates whether a call follows specific workflow requirements, resulting in a pass/fail outcome. These metrics are used to decide if a call fails or succeeds.

### Binary Qualitative
Provides a simple pass/fail assessment based on qualitative criteria. The result is a boolean value indicating whether the specified quality threshold was met.

### Continuous Qualitative
Measures quality on a continuous scale, returning percentage-based scores (0-100%). These metrics provide more granular quality assessments than binary metrics.

### Enum
Returns predefined categorical values instead of numerical scores. Useful for classifying results into distinct categories or states.

### Numeric
Measures quantifiable values such as latency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or other numerical measurements. Returns precise numerical values rather than percentages.

## Standard Metric Schema

All metrics outcome follow a consistent JSON schema:


```json
{
    "id": "string", // Unique identifier for the metric
    "name": "string", // Human-readable name of the metric
    "score": number, // Numerical score (0-100 for percentages, or specific values for numeric metrics)
    "enum": "string", // Optional: Categorical value for enum metrics
    "explanation": "string" // Detailed explanation of the metric result
}
```

### Notes
- The `enum` field is only present for enum-type metrics
- Binary metrics (both workflow and qualitative) return 0 or 100 as their score
- Continuous qualitative metrics return scores between 0 and 100
- Numeric metrics can return any numerical value appropriate for their measurement
