    Follow these steps to connect your Retell agent with Cekura's observability suite:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure webhook URL in Retell">
        In your Retell dashboard, navigate to your agent settings and add the observability webhook URL (can be configured at agent level or organization level):

        ```
        https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/retell/observe/
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Retell API key">
        Go to the API keys section in your Retell dashboard and ensure you have at least one API key configured.

      <Step title="Add credentials to Cekura">

      </Step>
      <Step title="Test your integration">
        Make a test call from Retell (phone number based or webcall). Your calls should now appear in the Cekura observability `Calls` section.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Forwarding Retell response">
    If you already have an existing webhook setup and want to forward the Retell response to Cekura's observability suite:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure forwarding endpoint">
        Set up a forwarding mechanism to send the Retell webhook response to Cekura's observability endpoint:

        ```
        POST https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/observe/
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add authentication headers">
        Include your Cekura API key in the request headers:

        ```
        X-CEKURA-API-KEY: <your_cekura_api_key>
        Content-Type: application/json
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Forward the request body">
        Forward the Retell webhook response to Cekura with the following request body structure:

        ```json
        {
          "agent": <agent_id_in_cekura>,
          "voice_recording_url": retell_response["recording_url"],
          "transcript_type": "retell",
          "transcript_json": retell_response["transcript_with_tool_calls"],
          "call_id": retell_response["call_id"],
          "call_ended_reason": retell_response["disconnection_reason"]
        }
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auto-fetch">
    Auto-fetch polls the Retell API every 30 seconds to fetch completed calls—no webhook configuration required.

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Your **Retell API key** configured in Cekura Agent Settings

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Auto-fetch">
        Navigate to your Agent Settings page in Cekura and enable the **Auto-fetch Calls** toggle.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify calls are syncing">
        Completed calls from your Retell account will automatically appear in the **Calls** section.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      Auto-fetch runs every 30 seconds and only fetches completed calls. If there are credential issues (invalid API key), auto-fetch will be automatically disabled. You can switch back to webhook-based observability at any time by disabling the toggle.
