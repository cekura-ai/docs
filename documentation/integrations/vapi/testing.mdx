<Note>
  You can test your agents directly on our platform without configuring API keys. Cekura will use internally generated transcripts for testing purposes. For a simpler setup without API keys, check out our guide on [testing custom agents](/documentation/guides/testing-agents/overview).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

To successfully integrate your VAPI agent, you will need the following:

- A **Cekura account**
- A **VAPI account** with a deployed Voice Assistant.
- Your **VAPI API Key** (for Cekura's Organization Settings).
- Your VAPI **Assistant ID** (for the Cekura Agent configuration).

## Testing with VAPI

This guide walks you through setting up and testing your Voice AI agents built on the **VAPI** platform using Cekura.

By linking your VAPI Assistant to Cekura, you can run automated test suites, analyze call performance, and ensure agent quality.

### Creating and Testing Your Agent

The quickest way to get started is by creating a new Agent in Cekura, which allows you to link your specific VAPI Assistant ID and provide your API Key if it hasn't been configured globally.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    1. Log in to your [Cekura Dashboard](https://dashboard.cekura.ai)
    2. Click the **Add Agent** or **Create Agent** button.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Agent Settings">
    1. Navigate to the **Agent Settings** panel.
    2. In the **Provider** dropdown, select **VAPI**.
    3. Enter the specific VAPI **Assistant ID** of the agent you want to test.
    4. Enter your VAPI **Private API Key** in the designated field.
    2. Click **Save** to create and configure the agent

    > **Prerequisite Note:** The VAPI Assistant ID is required to link a specific agent, and the VAPI Private API Key is required for Cekura to authenticate and communicate with VAPI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Test">
    Once your VAPI Agent is configured:

    1. Go to **Simulation → Evaluator**.
    2. Click **Generate Evaluators** to auto-create basic metrics.
    3. Choose a **Scenario** from the list (or create one).
    4. Click the **▶️ Play** button next to it to start your first test.
    5. Monitor the test in **Simulation → Runs Overview**.
    6. View **transcripts, audio, and metrics** in **Results**.
    7. Use **Re-run Failed** or **Lab → Optimize** to refine and rerun.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Value of VAPI Integration

Integrating your VAPI Assistant with Cekura unlocks powerful testing and observability features:

- **Detailed Tool Call Information:** You are able to see granular data on **tool calls** made by your VAPI agent during a conversation, which is critical for debugging complex workflows.
- **Metadata Access:** You are also able to access **any metadata** available from VAPI calls, enabling richer, context-aware evaluations of agent performance.
- **Automated Outbound Calling:** You can use Cekura's infrastructure for **automated outbound calling** to run large-scale, performance-driven test campaigns.

<Accordion title="Setting Up VAPI Integration (Across Agents)">
  This setup is recommended as it configures your VAPI API Key once, making it available **across all agents within your project**. If you complete this step, you will _not_ need to enter the API Key when creating subsequent VAPI agents.

  1. Log in to your [Cekura Dashboard](https://dashboard.cekura.ai).
  2. Click on the **Settings** button (usually on the top right of the navigation bar).
  3. Navigate to the **Provider API Keys** tab.
  1. Locate the VAPI section.
  2. Enter your VAPI **Private API Key** in the designated field.
  3. Click **Save Changes**.
