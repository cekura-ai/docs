## Overview

Mock tools allow you to simulate external tool calls during agent testing by providing predefined input-output mappings. This ensures consistent, predictable responses during testing scenarios, making it easier to evaluate your agent's performance and behavior.

Mock tools are particularly useful when:
- Testing agents that rely on external APIs or databases
- Creating reproducible test scenarios
- Avoiding dependencies on live third-party services
- Testing edge cases with specific response data
- Ensuring consistent test results across multiple runs

## How to Attach Mock Tool Data to Your Agent

There are two ways to set up mock tools for your agent:
1. **Auto-Fetch (Recommended)**: Automatically fetch tool configurations and generate mock data from your provider
2. **Manual Setup**: Manually add tool configurations and mock data

### Option 1: Auto-Fetch Tools (Recommended)

Auto-fetch automatically retrieves your tool configurations from your provider (VAPI, Retell, or ElevenLabs), generates realistic sample mock input/output data using AI, and configures your provider's tools to use Cekura's mock endpoints—all in one click.

**Prerequisites:**
- Your agent must have a provider configured (VAPI, Retell, or ElevenLabs)
- You must have entered an Assistant ID in your agent's provider settings

**To use Auto-Fetch:**

1. **Configure Your Provider Settings**
   - Go to the Cekura Dashboard and select your agent
   - In the agent settings, configure your provider (VAPI, Retell, or ElevenLabs)
   - Enter your Assistant ID (or Squad ID for VAPI squads) in the provider settings

2. **Open Mock Tools Section**
   - Scroll to the bottom of the agent settings page
   - Click on **Mock Tools** to expand the section

3. **Click Auto-Fetch**
   - Click the **"Auto-Fetch"** button
   - A confirmation dialog will appear explaining what will happen
   - Click **"Auto-Fetch"** to confirm

4. **What Happens Automatically:**
   - Cekura fetches all tool configurations from your provider
   - AI generates realistic sample input/output data based on your agent's context and recent call transcripts
   - Your provider's tools are updated to point to Cekura's mock endpoints:
     - **VAPI**: Creates cloned tools with mock URLs (original tools are preserved since VAPI tools are shared globally)
     - **Retell**: Updates tool URLs directly in your LLM/Flow configuration
     - **ElevenLabs**: Updates webhook tool URLs directly in your agent configuration

<Note>
  Auto-fetch supports VAPI (including squads), Retell, and ElevenLabs providers. For VAPI squads, tools from all member assistants are fetched and prefixed with the assistant name to avoid naming conflicts (e.g., `SalesAssistant_check_availability`).
</Note>

#### Restoring Original Tools

After using auto-fetch, you can restore your provider's tools to their original configuration at any time:

1. **Navigate to Mock Tools Section**
   - Go to your agent's settings and click on **Mock Tools**

2. **Click Restore Original Tools**
   - Click the **"Restore Original Tools"** button
   - This will:
     - Restore all tool URLs in your provider to their original endpoints
     - For VAPI: Delete the cloned mock tools
     - For Retell/ElevenLabs: Restore the original tool URLs in your configuration
   - Your mock tool data in Cekura will be removed

<Warning>
  Restoring original tools will disconnect your provider's tools from Cekura's mock endpoints. You'll need to run auto-fetch again if you want to re-enable mock tools.
</Warning>

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to manually configure your mock tools, or need more control over the mock data, you can add tools manually.

**Provide Agent tool details with mock tool data:**

1. **Navigate to Agent Settings**
   - Go to the Cekura Dashboard
   - Select the agent for which you want to add mock tools

2. **Add Mock Tool Data**
   - On the bottom of the right-hand side, click on **Mock Tools**
   - Click **"+ Add Tool"** button to add mock tool data
   - For each tool you need to add:
     - **Tool Name**: Must be the same as mentioned in the agent description
     - **Tool Description**: Describe what the tool does
     - **Input/Output Mock Data**: Provide sample data to define the format for keys and values (this also serves as initial test data)

<Note>
  The tool name must exactly match what's mentioned in your agent description. Any mismatch will result in the mock tool not being triggered during testing.

```json User Data Tool
[
  {
    "input": {"user_id": 1},
    "output": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  {
    "input": {"user_id": 2},
    "output": {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "age": 25,
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "status": "premium"
    }
  }
]
```

```json Inventory Check Tool
[
  {
    "input": {"product_id": "SKU123", "quantity": 5},
    "output": {
      "available": true,
      "in_stock": 50,
      "can_fulfill": true,
      "estimated_delivery": "2-3 business days"
    }
  },
  {
    "input": {"product_id": "SKU456", "quantity": 100},
    "output": {
      "available": false,
      "in_stock": 10,
      "can_fulfill": false,
      "message": "Insufficient stock"
    }
  }
]
```

```json Weather API Tool
[
  {
    "input": {"city": "New York", "unit": "celsius"},
    "output": {
      "temperature": 22,
      "conditions": "partly cloudy",
      "humidity": 65,
      "wind_speed": 10
    }
  },
  {
    "input": {"city": "London", "unit": "celsius"},
    "output": {
      "temperature": 15,
      "conditions": "rainy",
      "humidity": 80,
      "wind_speed": 15
    }
  }
]
```

### Step 2: Create New Evaluators

After setting up your mock tools, create evaluators to test your agent:

1. **Navigate to Evaluators Section**
   - Go to the Evaluators tab in your Cekura dashboard
   - Click on **"Create New Workflow Evaluator"**


### Step 3: Run the Evaluators

Execute your evaluators to test the agent with mock tools:

1. **Configure Mock Tool Endpoints**
   - **If you used Auto-Fetch**: Your provider's tools are already configured to use Cekura's mock endpoints. Skip to step 2.
   - **If you used Manual Setup**: Configure your agent with Cekura's mock tool endpoints instead of the actual tool URLs on VAPI, Retell, or your provider. Check the [Mock Tool API documentation](/api-reference/test_framework/post-mock-tool) for endpoint details.

2. **Start Test Execution**
   - Select the evaluators you created
   - Click **"Run Evaluator"** to start testing
   - Choose the number of test iterations if needed
