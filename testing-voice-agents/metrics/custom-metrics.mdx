## Types of Metrics
These are metrics defined by the user. These can be tailored to specific needs and requirements, allowing users to create custom evaluations that align with their unique goals and objectives.
We also support generation of custom metrics based on the user's voice agent purpose. Below is a list of various types of metrics users can pick to evaluate calls.

  <Accordion title="Binary Workflow Adherence" href="#binary-workflow-adherence">
    This metric directly affects the success/failure of a call.<br />
    It evaluates adherence to specific workflow steps, resulting in a simple yes/no outcome, indicating whether the workflow was followed correctly.<br />
    **Example** - if asked for discount by customer, the agent should offer 30% or less.
