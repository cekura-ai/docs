## What is Personality in Evaluators?

A personality defines how your evaluator behaves during conversations with your AI agent. It determines the language, tone, and behavioral characteristics of the testing agent, allowing you to simulate diverse real-world user interactions.

## Why Use Different Personalities?

Testing your AI agent against different personalities helps you:

- **Identify Edge Cases**: Discover how your agent responds to challenging conversational patterns
- **Test Real-World Conditions**: Simulate environments with background noise or interruptions
- **Ensure Accessibility**: Verify your agent works well with different languages and speaking styles

## Personality Components

### Language

The primary language in which the evaluator will communicate with your agent. This ensures your AI agent is tested in the languages it's designed to support.

### Behavioral Characteristics

Personalities control several behavioral aspects:

- **Background Noise**: Simulates real-world conditions like calling from a busy street or office
- **Interruption Patterns**: Tests how your agent handles being interrupted mid-sentence
- **Speaking Pace**: Varies from slow and deliberate to fast and hurried
- **Emotional Tone**: Ranges from calm and patient to frustrated or urgent

### Example Personalities

| Personality Type | Characteristics | Use Case |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Normal Male | Calm, clear speech, no interruptions | Baseline testing |
| Interrupter | Interruptions, urgent tone, fast pace | Interruption testing |
| Normal Male - Bg Noise | Street noise, caf√© ambiance | Real-world environment testing |
| Slow Speaker | Slower pace, accent variations | Interruption testing |
| Spanglish | Multilingual Personality | Language capability testing |

## Assigning Personalities to Evaluators

When creating or editing an evaluator, you can select from:

1. **Pre-defined Personalities**: Cekura's curated collection of common user types
2. **Custom Personalities**: Your own created personalities for specific testing needs

Each evaluator can have one personality assigned to it, ensuring consistent behavior across multiple test runs.

## Creating Custom Personalities

For detailed instructions on creating your own personalities, see [Creating Custom Personalities](/documentation/advanced/creating-custom-personalities).

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Test with Multiple Personalities**: When running evaluators, you can select multiple personalities to ensure your agent performs consistently across user types.

### Recommended Personality Mix

For comprehensive testing, consider creating evaluators with:

- 60% standard, clear communication
- 20% challenging conditions (background noise, interruptions)
- 10% non-native speakers or accent variations
- 10% edge cases (frustrated users, very fast/slow speakers)

This distribution mirrors real-world user demographics while ensuring thorough testing coverage.
