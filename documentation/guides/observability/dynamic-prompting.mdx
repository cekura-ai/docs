## Overview

Dynamic agent description allows you to modify your agent's description and instructions on-the-fly during observability. This powerful feature enables you to test different prompts, agent descriptions, and behaviors without changing your agent's core configuration, making it perfect for A/B testing and prompt optimization.

## How Dynamic Agent Description Works

When you send call data to Cekura's observability platform, you can include `dynamic_variables` in your request. These variables override your agent's default agent description for that specific call evaluation. This feature is useful for these use cases:

- If you use dynamic_variables in your AI agent's prompt
- You want to record calls under one agent on Cekura

## Setting Up Your Agent Description

Before using dynamic agent description, ensure your agent description on the Cekura platform is configured to handle dynamic variables. You can add dynamic variables using the `{{ }}` syntax in your agent description.

### Examples of Dynamic Variables

**Full prompt replacement:**

```
{{prompt}}
```

**Mixed content with variables:**

```
You are a {{agent_type}} assistant. Your primary goal is to {{primary_goal}}.
Always be {{tone}} and focus on {{focus_area}}.
```

**Multiple variables:**

```
You are a {{role}} working for {{company}}.
Your expertise includes {{expertise_areas}}.
Always respond in a {{communication_style}} manner.
```

**Important**: Set your agent description in the dashboard to work with dynamic prompting. The agent should be configured to accept and process the dynamic prompt variable effectively.

## API Integration

### Retell Integration Example

When integrating with Retell, use the [Cekura Observe API](/api-reference/observability/post-observabilityv1observe) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "call_id": "retell_response.call_id",
  "transcript_type": "retell",
  "transcript_json": "retell_response.transcript_with_tool_calls",
  "call_ended_reason": "retell_response.disconnect_reason",
  "voice_recording_url": "retell_response.recording_url",
  "dynamic_variables": {
    "prompt": "Your custom prompt as a string"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Example

Here's a practical example of how to implement dynamic agent description with Retell:

```javascript
// After receiving a webhook from Retell
const observeData = {
  call_id: retellWebhook.call_id,
  transcript_type: "retell",
  transcript_json: retellWebhook.transcript_with_tool_calls,
  call_ended_reason: retellWebhook.disconnect_reason,
  voice_recording_url: retellWebhook.recording_url,
  dynamic_variables: {
    prompt: `You are a helpful customer service representative. 
             Be empathetic and solution-focused. 
             Always confirm understanding before proceeding.
             Prioritize customer satisfaction above all else.`,
  },
};

// Send to Cekura Observability
const response = await fetch("https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/observe", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-CEKURA-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(observeData),
});
```
