## Agent Setup Guide

### Create an Agent

1. Go to Agent Settings (If you are a new user, click **Create an Agent** from the left navigation bar to get started.)
2. Add name, contact number, and language of the agent to be tested
3. Add Agent Description.

### Agent Description

Agent Description is a comprehensive overview of your voice conversational agent’s purpose, behaviour, and operational guidelines. It encapsulates all the instructions, prompts, and rules you provide to your AI agent.

> By clearly articulating your agent’s description, you enable us to **generate automatic, accurate evaluators.**

<Info>
  Most customers include their `agent’s main prompt` here.
</Info>

#### Description Type

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Prompt Agent">
    For Single prompt agents, you can copy the agent's main prompt here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi State Agent">
    <Tip>
      If you have multi-state agent, you can build a description in a json structure. \
      Note - We are very flexible with description so even if you copy paste all your prompts and paste as one huge prompt, we can process. JSON is the recommended approach.

      ```json
      [
      {
      "node_name": "<>",
      "node_description": "<>"
      },
      {
      "node_name": "<>",
      "node_description": "<>"
      }
      ]
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retell Workflows">
    <Tip>
      If you have an agent with retell workflows, you can export the agent's details as json from retell. \
      Go to agents \> select the agent \> click on export button (this will download a .json file) \> copy the content of the file and paste it in agent description field.

      ![Retell Export](/images/retell/agent_description_workflow.png)
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vapi Workflows">
    <Tip>
      If you have an agent with vapi workflows, you can export the agent's details as json from vapi. \
      Go to workflows \> select the agent \> click on `code` button on top right\> copy the content shown and paste it in agent description field.

      ![Vapi Export](/images/vapi/agent_description_workflow.png)
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
