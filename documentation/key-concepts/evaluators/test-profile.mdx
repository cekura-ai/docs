description: "A test profile gives your evaluator a specific identity with personal information such as name, date of birth, address, phone number, and other relevant details. This allows the evaluator to provide consistent, realistic identity information during conversations with your AI agent."

<Note>
  Adding test profile is optional. Cekura will automatically generate a default
  test profile for you if you don't add one.

Some evaluators like general information inquiries, FAQ testing, etc don't require test profiles.

## Overview

Test profiles are essential when your AI agent needs to:

- **Verify Identity**: Confirm the caller's identity before proceeding with sensitive actions
- **Lookup Records**: Find specific accounts, appointments, or orders based on personal information
- **Personalize Interactions**: Address the caller by name or reference their specific details
- **Authenticate Users**: Verify security questions or personal details

### Common Use Cases

| Scenario               | Required Information                     | Example                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Healthcare Appointment | Name, DOB, Phone Number                  | "I'm calling to cancel my appointment" |
| Banking Support        | Name, Account Number, DOB, Address       | "I need help with my account"          |
| E-commerce Returns     | Name, Order Number, Email                | "I want to return an order"            |
| Hotel Reservations     | Name, Confirmation Number, Check-in Date | "I need to modify my reservation"      |

## Test Profile Step Guide

### Setup Process

1. **Create Test Data in Your System**: Add mock records (appointments, accounts, orders) with specific test information
2. **Create Matching Test Profile**: Create a test profile with the same information in Cekura
3. **Attach to Evaluator**: Assign the test profile to your evaluator
4. **Run Tests**: The evaluator will use the profile information during conversations

### Example: Clinic Receptionist

Let's say you have a clinic receptionist AI agent that can cancel appointments. The agent verifies identity by asking for the patient's date of birth before cancellation.

**Step-by-Step Setup:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create mock appointment in your system">
    Create a test appointment with:
    - Patient Name: John Smith
    - Date of Birth: January 1, 2000
    - Appointment Date: March 15, 2025
    - Appointment ID: APT-12345
  </Step>

<Step title="Create matching test profile in Cekura">
```json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "dob": "01/01/2000",
  "phone": "+1-555-0123",
  "appointment_id": "APT-12345"
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create evaluator with instructions">
  Create an evaluator with instructions: "Call to cancel the appointment
  scheduled for March 15, 2025. Provide date of birth when asked for
  verification."
</Step>

  <Step title="Attach test profile to evaluator">
    Assign the "John Smith" test profile to this evaluator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**During Testing:**

When the evaluator converses with your agent:

1. Evaluator: "Hi, I'd like to cancel my appointment."
2. Agent: "I can help with that. Can I have your date of birth for verification?"
3. Evaluator: "January 1, 2000" _(from test profile)_
4. Agent: "Thank you. I see you have an appointment on March 15, 2025. Would you like to cancel this?"
5. Evaluator: "Yes, please."
6. Agent: "Your appointment has been cancelled. Your confirmation number is APT-12345."

### Test Profile Fields

A test profile can include:

- **Name**: First and last name
- **Date of Birth**: DOB in various formats
- **Address**: Full mailing address
- **Phone Number**: Contact number
- **Email**: Email address
- **Account/Customer ID**: Unique identifiers
- **Security Information**: Answers to security questions
- **Custom Fields**: Any additional information your agent might need

<Tip>
  **Keep Test Profiles Organized**: Use clear naming conventions like
  "Customer-Banking-Premium" or "Patient-Dental-Regular" to easily identify
  which test profile to use for different scenarios.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### 1. Synchronize Test Data

Ensure your test profile information matches exactly what exists in your backend system. Mismatches will cause verification failures.

```
❌ Incorrect:
System DOB: 01/01/2000
Profile DOB: 1 January 2000
(Agent might not match these formats)

✅ Correct:
System DOB: 01/01/2000
Profile DOB: 01/01/2000
```

### 2. Create Multiple Test Profiles

Build a library of test profiles for different scenarios:

- Happy path scenarios (everything matches perfectly)
- Edge cases (partial information, multiple matches)
- Negative scenarios (wrong information, no matches)

### 3. Update Profiles Regularly

When your system's data structure changes, update your test profiles accordingly. Outdated profiles lead to failed tests that don't reflect real issues.
