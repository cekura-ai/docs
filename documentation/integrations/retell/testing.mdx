## Prerequisites

- A Cekura account
- A deployed Retell Assistant.
- Your Retell **API Key**.
- The Retell **Assistant ID** of the voice agent you wish to test.

## Testing with Retell

This guide walks you through setting up and testing your Voice AI agents built on the Retell platform using Cekura.

By linking your Retell Assistant to Cekura, you can run automated test suites, analyze call performance, and ensure agent quality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    1. Navigate to the **Agents** section using the side navigation bar.
    2. Click the **Add Agent** or **Create Agent** button.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Agent Settings">
    1. Navigate to the **Agent Settings** panel.
    2. In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Retell**.
    3. Enter the specific Retell **Assistant ID** of the agent you want to test.
    4. Enter your Retell **API Key** in the designated field.
    5. Click **Save** to create and configure the agent.

       > **Note:** The Retell Assistant ID is unique to each agent and is required for Cekura to simulate calls with the correct Retell workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Test">
    Once your Retell Agent is configured:

    1. Go to **Simulation → Evaluator**.
    2. Click **Generate Evaluators** to auto-create basic metrics.
    3. Choose a **Scenario** from the list (or create one).
    4. Click the **▶️ Play** button next to it to start your first test.
    5. Monitor the test in **Simulation → Runs Overview**.
    6. View **transcripts, audio, and metrics** in **Results**.
    7. Use **Re-run Failed** or **Lab → Optimize** to refine and rerun.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Value of Retell Integration

Integrating your Retell Agent with Cekura unlocks powerful testing and observability features:

- **Detailed Tool Call Information:** Cekura is able to capture and display granular data on **tool calls** made by your Retell agent during a conversation, which is critical for debugging complex workflows.
- **Metadata Access:** Access **any metadata** available from Retell calls, enabling richer, context-aware evaluations of agent performance.
- **Automated Outbound Calling:** Leverage Cekura's infrastructure for **automated outbound calling** to run large-scale, performance-driven test campaigns.

## Setting Up Retell Integration (Across Agents)

This setup is recommended as it configures your Retell API Key once, making it available **across all Retell agents within your project**. Completing this step means you **will not** need to enter the API Key when creating subsequent Retell agents.

### 1. Accessing Provider API Keys

1. Log in to your [Cekura Dashboard](https://dashboard.cekura.ai).
2. Click on the **Settings** button (usually on the top right of the navigation bar).
3. Navigate to the **Provider API Keys** tab.

### 2. Configuring the Retell API Key

1. Locate the Retell section.
2. Enter your Retell **API Key** in the designated field.
3. Click **Save Changes**.
