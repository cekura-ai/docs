## Overview

Low Credits Alerts notify organization admins when your credit balance drops below a configurable threshold. Cekura sends an email with your current balance and a link to add more credits.

## How It Works

Cekura monitors your organization's credit balance. When it falls below your threshold:

1. An email notification is sent to all organization admins
2. The notification includes your current credits and organization name
3. You only receive one notification per threshold breach

<Note>
Notifications reset when you add credits and your balance rises above the threshold. The alert will trigger again if your balance drops below the threshold in the future.
</Note>

## Configuration

### Enable Low Credits Alerts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Organization Settings">
    Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **General** in the Cekura dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Notifications">
    Toggle **Low Credits Notifications** to ON.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Threshold">
    Enter your threshold in the **Low Credits Threshold** field. Default is 1,000 credits.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply your settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API Configuration

You can also configure low credits alerts via the Organization API:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.cekura.ai/user/organizations/{organization_id}/ \
  -H "X-CEKURA-API-KEY: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "notify_low_credits": true,
    "low_credits_threshold": 500
  }'
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `notify_low_credits` | boolean | Enable or disable low credits email notifications. Default: `false` |
| `low_credits_threshold` | number | The credit balance threshold that triggers notifications. Default: `1000` |


<Tip>
Enable auto-refill in your billing settings to automatically top up credits when your balance runs low.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Set an appropriate threshold**: Choose a value that gives you time to add credits before running out based on your typical daily usage.
- **Keep admin emails current**: Only organization admins receive alerts, so assign admin roles to members who can act on billing.
- **Combine with auto-refill**: Use alerts alongside auto-refill to catch any issues with automatic payments.
