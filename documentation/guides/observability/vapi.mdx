## Overview

Learn how to monitor, analyze, and optimize your VAPI-based voice agents using Cekura's observability tools. This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring your VAPI integration.

## Setting Up VAPI Integration

### Server URL Configuration

To connect your application with VAPI, you'll need to configure the Server URL. This URL is used for all communication between your application and VAPI, including context retrieval, function calls, and end-of-call reporting.

The Server URL should be set to your VAPI endpoint in the following format:
```
https://new-prod.cekura.ai/observability/v1/vapi/observe/?agent_id=YOUR_AGENT_ID
```

### Assistant ID Setup

Each VAPI agent has a unique Assistant ID that identifies your specific implementation. You can find your Assistant ID in the VAPI dashboard:

### API Key Configuration

For security purposes, you'll need to set up an API key that will be included with each request to the VAPI server. This key is sent as a header `X-VAPI-SECRET` with each request.

#### Getting Your API Key

To obtain your API key from the dashboard.cekura.ai platform:

1. Navigate to the API Keys section in the left sidebar of your dashboard:

2. In the API Keys modal, you can view and copy your private API key:

Keep this key secure and never share it publicly, as it provides access to your VAPI integration.

## Request Body Example

When using VAPI, here's what the request body will look like when creating a new call log entry in Cekura:

```json
{
  "agent": <agent_id_in_vocera>,
  "recording_url": vapi_response["recordingUrl"],
  "transcript_type": "vapi",
  "transcript_json": vapi_response["messages"],
  "call_id": vapi_response["id"]
}
```
