You should be all set now. Simply make a call from Elevenlabs (phone number based or even webcall) to test it out. The calls will start appearing in the observability `Calls` section

## Request Body Example

When using Elevenlabs, here's what the request body will look like when creating a new call log entry in Cekura:

```json
{
  "agent": <agent_id_in_cekura>,
  "transcript_type": "elevenlabs",
  "transcript_json": elevenlabs_response["transcript"],
  "call_id": elevenlabs_response["conversation_id"]
}
```
