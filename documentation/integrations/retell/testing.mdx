## Prerequisites

- A Cekura account
- A deployed Retell Assistant.
- Your Retell **API Key**.
- The Retell **Assistant ID** of the voice agent you wish to test.

## Testing with Retell

This guide walks you through setting up and testing your Voice AI agents built on the Retell platform using Cekura.

By linking your Retell Assistant to Cekura, you can run automated test suites, analyze call performance, and ensure agent quality.

<Tab title="Voice">

Test your Retell voice agents with automated call simulation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    1. Navigate to the **Agents** section using the side navigation bar.
    2. Click the **Add Agent** or **Create Agent** button.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Agent Settings">
    1. Navigate to the **Agent Settings** panel.
    2. In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Retell**.
    3. Enter the specific Retell **Assistant ID** of the agent you want to test.
    4. Enter your Retell **API Key** in the designated field.
    5. Click **Save** to create and configure the agent.

       ![Retell Agentsettings Pn](/images/retell_agentsettings.png)

       > **Note:** The Retell Assistant ID is unique to each agent and is required for Cekura to simulate calls with the correct Retell workflow.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Test">
    Once your Retell Agent is configured:

    1. Go to **Simulation → Evaluator**.
    2. Click **Generate Evaluators** to auto-create basic metrics.
    3. Choose a **Scenario** from the list (or create one).
    4. Click the **▶️ Play** button next to it to start your first test.
    5. Monitor the test in **Simulation → Runs Overview**.
    6. View **transcripts, audio, and metrics** in **Results**.
    7. Use **Re-run Failed** or **Lab → Optimize** to refine and rerun.

  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Chat">

Test your Retell chat agents through text-based interactions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Retell Chat Agent">
    First, ensure you have a chat-compatible version of your agent:

    1. Log in to your **Retell Dashboard**.
    2. Locate the voice agent you want to test as a chat agent.
    3. Use the **Copy as chat agent** option to create a text-based version of your agent.
    4. Note the **Agent ID** of your chat agent - you'll need this for Cekura configuration.

       ![Retell Convert to Chat Agent Pn](/images/retell_convert_to_chat_agent.png)

       > **Note:** The chat version enables text-based interactions while maintaining the same conversation logic as your voice agent.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Retell to Cekura">
    Link your Retell chat agent to the Cekura platform:

    1. Navigate to the **Agents Settings** section using the side navigation bar.
    3. In **Agent Settings**, go to the **Chatbot Integrations** box on the right.
    4. Select **Retell** as the provider.
    5. Enter your Retell chat agent's **Agent ID** in the Assistant Id field.
    6. In the voice integration box, select Retell, and enter your Retell **API Key** in the designated field.
    7. Click **Save** to create and configure the agent.

       ![Retell Agentsettings Pn](/images/retell_agentsettings.png)

       > **Important:** Make sure to use the Assistant ID from your chat agent (created in Step 1), not your voice agent.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Chat Tests">
    Execute your tests to ensure results appear on the dashboard:

    1. Navigate to **Evaluator**.
    2. Click **Generate Evaluators** or **Create Evaluators** (Skip this step if you already have evaluators created).
    3. Choose a **Evaluator** from the list
    4. When initiating a test run, select the **Run as Text** option.

       > **Critical:** Selecting **Run as Text** ensures the system treats the interaction as a chat session rather than a voice call.

    5. Monitor the test in **Results** section.

       > **Tip:** Chat testing is ideal for rapid iteration on conversation design before deploying to voice.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Helpful Tips

- **Run Workflow Testing:** Even if you are building voice agents on Retell, running them in text mode is much faster and cheaper. You will be able to effectively test the workflow of your agent with this approach we use the chat endpoint provided by Retell.
- **No Phone Number needed:** With chat testing, you do not need to configure any phone number on Retell.

## Value of Retell Integration

Integrating your Retell Agent with Cekura unlocks powerful testing and observability features:

- **Detailed Tool Call Information:** Cekura is able to capture and display granular data on **tool calls** made by your Retell agent during a conversation, which is critical for debugging complex workflows.
- **Metadata Access:** Access **any metadata** available from Retell calls, enabling richer, context-aware evaluations of agent performance.
- **Automated Outbound Calling:** Leverage Cekura's infrastructure for **automated outbound calling** to run large-scale, performance-driven test campaigns.

<Accordion title="Setting Up Retell Integration (Across Agents)">
  This setup is recommended as it configures your Retell API Key once, making it available **across all Retell agents within your project**. Completing this step means you **will not** need to enter the API Key when creating subsequent Retell agents.

1. Log in to your [Cekura Dashboard](https://dashboard.cekura.ai).
2. Click on the **Settings** button (usually on the top right of the navigation bar).
3. Navigate to the **Provider API Keys** tab.
4. Locate the Retell section.
5. Enter your Retell **API Key** in the designated field.
6. Click **Save Changes**.
