## What is PII Redaction?

PII redaction automatically detects and removes sensitive information from both transcripts and audio recordings. This ensures compliance with privacy and security requirements while maintaining the overall context of conversations.

### Example

**Original:**
```
[00:04] Main Agent: Thank you for calling the office of Guernsey County Sheriff, Jeffrey d Peyton. How can I help?
```

**Redacted:**
```
[00:04] Main Agent: Thank you for calling the office of <LOCATION>, <PERSON>. How can I help?
```

## How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Transcript Redaction">
    Gemini AI identifies entities for the selected entity types and replaces them with standardized tokens.

    **Example tokens:**
    - `<PERSON>` - Person names
    - `<LOCATION>` - Geographic locations
    - `<EMAIL>` - Email addresses
    - `<PHONE>` - Phone numbers
    - `<SSN>` - Social Security Numbers
    - `<CREDIT_CARD>` - Credit card numbers
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Audio Redaction">
    1. Transcribe audio using ElevenLabs Scribe v2 to get word-level timestamps
    2. Identify entities using Gemini AI for the selected entity types
    3. Map entity timestamps from ElevenLabs transcription
    4. Replace audio segments with high-frequency beeps

    <Note>
      Audio redaction ensures that even if someone accesses the recording file directly, they cannot hear sensitive information.

## Using Redaction

Add the `redact_fields` parameter when sending calls to the [observe API endpoint](/api-reference/observability/send-calls):

```json
{
  "agent": "your_agent_id",
  "transcript_json": [...],
  "voice_recording_url": "https://...",
  "redact_fields": ["phone_number", "email_address", "ssn"]
}
```

<Note>
  If `redact_fields` is not provided or is an empty array, no redaction will occur.
