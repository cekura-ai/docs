## Overview

Dynamic prompting allows you to modify your agent's behavior and instructions on-the-fly during observability. This powerful feature enables you to test different prompts, agent descriptions, and behaviors without changing your agent's core configuration, making it perfect for A/B testing and prompt optimization.

## How Dynamic Prompting Works

When you send call data to Cekura's observability platform, you can include `dynamic_variables` in your request. These variables override your agent's default settings for that specific call evaluation, allowing you to:

- Test different agent descriptions and prompts
- Experiment with various instruction sets
- Compare agent performance across different configurations
- Optimize your agent's behavior based on real call data

## Setting Up Your Agent Description

Before using dynamic prompting, ensure your agent description on the Cekura platform is configured to handle dynamic variables. Your agent description should include placeholders or reference points that can be dynamically replaced.

**Important**: Set your agent description in the dashboard to work with dynamic prompting. The agent should be configured to accept and process the dynamic prompt variable effectively.

## API Integration

### Retell Integration Example

When integrating with Retell, use the [Cekura Observe API](/api-reference/observability/post-observabilityv1observe) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "call_id": "retell_response.call_id",
  "transcript_type": "retell",
  "transcript_json": "retell_response.transcript_with_tool_calls",
  "call_ended_reason": "retell_response.disconnect_reason",
  "voice_recording_url": "retell_response.recording_url",
  "dynamic_variables": {
    "prompt": "Your custom prompt as a string"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Example

Here's a practical example of how to implement dynamic prompting with Retell:

```javascript
// After receiving a webhook from Retell
const observeData = {
  call_id: retellWebhook.call_id,
  transcript_type: "retell",
  transcript_json: retellWebhook.transcript_with_tool_calls,
  call_ended_reason: retellWebhook.disconnect_reason,
  voice_recording_url: retellWebhook.recording_url,
  dynamic_variables: {
    prompt: `You are a helpful customer service representative. 
             Be empathetic and solution-focused. 
             Always confirm understanding before proceeding.
             Prioritize customer satisfaction above all else.`,
  },
};

// Send to Cekura Observability
const response = await fetch("https://api.cekura.ai/observability/v1/observe", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(observeData),
});
```
