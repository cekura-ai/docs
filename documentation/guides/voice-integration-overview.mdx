## How Voice Integration Works

Cekura's voice integration system allows you to evaluate your voice agents through a simple three-step process:

1. **We make a call**: Cekura initiates calls to your voice agents using your chosen provider (Retell, VAPI, etc.)
2. **We fetch transcript from your end**: Once the call is complete, we retrieve the transcript and match it to the correct call
3. **We analyse your transcript and show a report**: Cekura analyzes the conversation and provides detailed evaluation results in your dashboard

## Advantages of Integration

  <Card title=" Tool Call Testing" icon="wrench">
    Most platforms like VAPI, Retell, and others capture tool call information in the transcript. This enables comprehensive evaluation of whether your agent is using tools correctly with proper parameters and timing.

  <Card title=" Easy Debugging" icon="bug">
    We capture transcripts from both ends of the conversation. This dual-perspective approach allows us to provide deeper insights by comparing what was sent versus what was received, making debugging faster and more effective.

## Tool Call Evaluation

### Understanding Tool Calls in Transcripts

When your voice agent uses tools or functions, this information is captured in the transcript. Here's what gets analyzed:

#### Tool Call Structure
```json
{
  "role": "Function Call",
  "data": {
    "id": "call_5otWH44dxeXEHY8RlhYYaFbV",
    "name": "bookUserAppointment",
    "arguments": "{\"name\": \"John\", \"datetime\": \"2024-10-17T18:00:00\"}"
  },
  "start_time": 23.164,
  "end_time": 23.164
}
```

#### Tool Result Analysis
```json
{
  "role": "Function Call Result",
  "data": {
    "id": "call_5otWH44dxeXEHY8RlhYYaFbV",
    "name": "bookUserAppointment",
    "result": "Appointment successfully booked for John at 6 PM today"
  },
  "start_time": 24.6,
  "end_time": 24.6
}
```
