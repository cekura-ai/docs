### Steps to Set Up Observability

1. **Obtain Your API Key**

   - Log in to your [Vocera dashboard](https://dashboard.vocera.ai) to retrieve your API key. You can find them in the bottom left panel by expanding the organisation menu. This key is essential for authenticating your requests and accessing observability features.

4. **Start Pushing Logs**

   - Use our API to start pushing logs to the observability platform. This will allow you to track and analyze log data in real-time, providing deeper insights into your system's operations.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize observability features to gain insights into your system's performance.
