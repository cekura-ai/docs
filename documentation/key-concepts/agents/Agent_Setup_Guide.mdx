Agent Description is a comprehensive overview of your voice conversational agent’s purpose, behavior, and operational guidelines. It encapsulates all the instructions, prompts, and rules you provide to your AI agent, acting as the foundational reference for how the agent should interact with users and handle various scenarios.

> By clearly articulating your agent’s description, you enable us to **generate more accurate test scenarios** and **identify issues in production**.

<Info>
  Most customers include their `agent’s main prompt` here.

## Detailed Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Prompt Agent">
    For Single prompt agents, you can copy the agent's main prompt here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi State Agent">
    <Tip>
      If you have multi-state agent, you can build a description in a json structure. \
      Note - We are very flexible with description so even if you copy paste all your prompts and paste as one huge prompt, we can process. JSON is the recommended approach.

      ```json
      [
      {
      "node_name": "<>",
      "node_description": "<>"
      },
      {
      "node_name": "<>", 
      "node_description": "<>"
      }
      ]
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retell Workflows">
    <Tip>
      If you have an agent with retell workflows, you can export the agent's details as json from retell. \
      Go to agents \> select the agent \> click on export button (this will download a .json file) \> copy the content of the file and paste it in agent description field.
