4. **Start Pushing Logs**

   - Use our API to start pushing logs to the observability platform. This will allow you to track and analyze log data in real-time, providing deeper insights into your system's operations.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize observability features to gain insights into your system's performance.
